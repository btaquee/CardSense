## Next Steps

### To Merge Backend Changes into Your Frontend Branch

Since you're working on `frontend_draft` and the backend is on `main`, you have a few options:

#### Option 1: Merge main into frontend_draft (Recommended)
This brings all backend changes into your branch:

```bash
git checkout frontend_draft
git merge main
# Resolve any conflicts if they occur
```

#### Option 2: Rebase frontend_draft on main
This replays your frontend commits on top of main:

```bash
git checkout frontend_draft
git rebase main
# Resolve any conflicts if they occur
```

#### Option 3: Continue as-is
Keep working on `frontend_draft` with these updated services. When you're ready to merge, you can merge both branches together.

## Testing the Integration

### 1. Make sure you have the backend code
```bash
git merge main  # Or follow Option 1 above
```

### 2. Start the backend
```bash
# In CardSense root directory
python manage.py runserver
```

### 3. Start the frontend
```bash
# In CardSense/web directory
npm start
```

### 4. Test the APIs
Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/ to see available endpoints

## Important Notes

1. **The frontend services are now correctly aligned with the backend API structure**
2. **All TypeScript types match the backend data models**
3. **Build completes successfully with no errors**
4. **You'll need to update your UI components** to use the new data structure (e.g., `is_active` instead of `is_primary`)
5. **Authentication must be implemented** before testing user-specific endpoints
